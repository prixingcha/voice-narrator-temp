        Now, let‚Äôs talk about the history of this mountain. It was first conquered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. And since then, it has become a popular destination for thrill-seekers and Instagram influencers alike. But let‚Äôs be real, most of us will never climb this mountain. We‚Äôll just watch documentaries about it and pretend we‚Äôre there.
    Speaking of documentaries, did you know that there are more documentaries about Mount Everest than there are people who have actually climbed it? That‚Äôs right, you can watch hours and hours of people freezing their butts off and risking their lives for a chance to stand on top of a mountain. And if you‚Äôre lucky, you might even get to see someone take a dump in a bucket. Now that‚Äôs what I call entertainment.
    But in all seriousness, climbing Mount Everest is no joke. It‚Äôs dangerous, it‚Äôs expensive, and it‚Äôs not for the faint of heart. But if you‚Äôre up for the challenge, it can be a life-changing experience. Just don‚Äôt forget to bring a warm jacket and a selfie stick.
    I hope you enjoyed this snarky and funny documentary about Mount Everest. And remember, if you ever decide to climb this mountain, don‚Äôt forget to take a selfie at the top. It‚Äôs the ultimate flex.
